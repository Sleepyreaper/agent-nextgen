## 🎯 Vision & Purpose

The School Detail Data Scientist system addresses a critical gap in Moana's (School Context Agent) ability to provide nuanced, data-driven analysis of student opportunities within their school context.

### Problem Statement
- **Moana's Current Limitation**: Limited to extracting information directly from embedded URLs in uploads
- **Data Gap**: Lacks comprehensive, pre-analyzed school profiles with opportunity metrics
- **Inconsistency**: Multiple students from same school may receive different contextual analysis
- **Human Review Gap**: No way to validate, audit, or improve school data quality

### Solution Architecture
Build a comprehensive school indexing and enrichment system that:
1. Analyzes schools using web data to build enriched profiles
2. Calculates composite "opportunity scores" reflecting school capabilities
3. Provides human review dashboard for quality assurance
4. Enables Moana to access pre-analyzed school data
5. Tracks changes and improvements over time

## 📊 Data Model Overview

### Core Tables

#### `school_enriched_data` (Primary)
Main table storing all analyzed school information:

```sql
- school_name, school_district, state_code, county_name
- opportunity_score (0-100) - PRIMARY METRIC

- Demographics (students, graduation rate, free lunch %)
- Outcomes (college acceptance, salary data)
- Analysis tracking (status, confidence, last updated)
- Human review status (pending, reviewed, approved)
- Web sources analyzed (JSON array of URLs)
- Data confidence score (0-100)
```

#### `school_web_sources`
Tracks URL sources for each school:
- source_url, source_type (website, state_edu, nces, glassdoor, etc)
- data_retrieved_at, content_summary
- is_active flag for managing data freshness

#### `school_academic_profile`
Detailed academic capabilities:
- AP courses list, exam pass rates, student participation
- Honors & advanced course offerings

## 🤖 School Detail Data Scientist Agent

### Agent Architecture

Located: `src/agents/school_detail_data_scientist.py`

#### Primary Methods

**`analyze_school()`**
```python
analyze_school(
    school_name: str,
    school_district: Optional[str],
    state_code: Optional[str],
    web_sources: Optional[List[str]],
    existing_data: Optional[Dict]
) -> Dict[str, Any]
```

Returns enriched profile with:
- Academic profile analysis
- Salary outcomes modeling
- Demographic profile
- Opportunity metrics (composite scoring)
- Analysis summary and confidence scores

**`_analyze_web_sources()`**
- Classifies source types (state education, federal, college data, salary, community)
- Extracts relevant data from each source
- Tracks scraping success rate
- Builds data source profile

**`_build_academic_profile()`**
- Extracts AP/IB/Advanced course counts
- College acceptance and readiness metrics
- STEM program availability
- Dual enrollment options
- College counseling capacity

**`_calculate_opportunity_score()`**
Composite scoring algorithm:

```
Academic Opportunity (35%):
  - AP availability (30%)
  - College acceptance rate (35%)
  - College counseling (20%)
  - College readiness (15%)

Resource Opportunity (25%):
  - Class size (25%)
  - Student/teacher ratio (25%)
  - School investment level (25%)
  - STEM programs (25%)

College Prep Opportunity (25%):
  - College acceptance rate (40%)
  - Dual enrollment (30%)
  - College prep focus (30%)

Socioeconomic Opportunity (15%):
  - Resource availability (50%)
  - Programs for disadvantaged (35%)
  - Community sentiment (15%)

OVERALL = (Academic × 0.35) + (Resource × 0.25) + 
          (CollegePrep × 0.25) + (Socioeconomic × 0.15)
```

### Integration Points

#### With Moana (School Context Agent)
```python
# Moana can query pre-analyzed school data:
school_data = db.get_school_enriched_data(school_name, state_code)

# Use for enhanced context:
- School capability assessment
- Comparative advantage analysis
- Regional opportunity evaluation
- Student program access quantification
```

#### With Application Processing
```python
# Schools are indexed during:
1. Application upload (if school mentioned)
2. Manual school addition via admin dashboard
3. Batch processing of new schools
4. Reprocessing with human-reviewed data
```

```

### Example: Moana's Enhanced Analysis

**Before**: "Student attends Lincoln High School with good AP offerings"

**After**: 
```
"Student attends Lincoln High School (Opportunity Score: 78/100)
- Above-average academic opportunity (82): 24 AP courses, 89% pass rate
- Strong resource allocation (75): 15:1 student/teacher ratio
- Excellent college prep focus (88): 96% college acceptance
- Serving 42% disadvantaged population with strong support

REGIONAL CONTEXT: Lincoln outperforms GA average salary ($58k) with 
$64k median graduate salary. Provides meaningful opportunity for 
upward mobility, particularly in STEM pathways (5 STEM programs).

COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE: Student's school provides above-state-average 
foundation. Should be encouraged to leverage dual enrollment and 
AP course load to maximize opportunity."
```

## 🎓 How Moana Will Use School Data

### Enhanced Context Construction

```python
def build_school_context(school_name, state_code, student_data):
    # 1. Get pre-analyzed school data
    school = db.get_school_enriched_data(school_name, state_code)
    
    # 2. Extract key metrics
    opportunity_score = school.opportunity_score
    academic_profile = school.academic_profile
    salary_outcomes = school.salary_outcomes
    
    # 3. Build comparative analysis
    comparison = {
        'school_vs_state': opportunity_score - get_state_avg(),
        'ap_access': academic_profile.ap_course_count,
        'college_trajectory': salary_outcomes.college_enrollment_rate,
        'regional_salary': salary_outcomes.avg_all_fields_median_salary
    }
    
    # 4. Generate insight
    context = f"""
    School Opportunity Context:
    {school.school_name} provides {opportunity_score}/100 opportunity.
    
    Strengths: {school.key_strengths}
    Areas for Growth: {school.areas_for_improvement}
    
    For this student with {student_data.gpa} GPA:
    - Recommended programs: {get_recommendations(student_data, academic_profile)}
    - Realistic outcomes: {project_outcomes(student_data, salary_outcomes)}
    """
    
    return context
