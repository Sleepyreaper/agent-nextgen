PERSONAL STATEMENT

I am writing to express my strong interest in the NextGen Internship Program. As a junior at Washington High School, I have maintained a 3.9 GPA while challenging myself with advanced coursework including AP Calculus, AP Chemistry, and AP Computer Science.

ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENTS

Throughout my high school career, I have consistently demonstrated a passion for STEM subjects. I scored 5 on my AP Calculus BC exam and 4 on AP Chemistry. I am currently enrolled in dual enrollment courses at our local community college, taking Introduction to Data Science.

EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES

Beyond academics, I am deeply involved in our school community:
- President of the Robotics Club (led team to regional championships)
- Volunteer tutor for middle school math students (2 years, 100+ hours)
- Member of National Honor Society

LEADERSHIP AND IMPACT

As Robotics Club President, I organized our team's first community outreach event, teaching elementary students basic programming concepts using Scratch. We reached over 50 students and sparked their interest in technology.

FUTURE GOALS

I aspire to pursue a degree in Computer Engineering and ultimately work on developing accessible technology solutions for underserved communities. The NextGen program aligns perfectly with my goals of gaining hands-on experience in real-world applications of technology.

WHY NEXTGEN

I am particularly drawn to NextGen because of its focus on mentorship and practical problem-solving. I believe my strong academic foundation, leadership experience, and passion for technology make me an excellent fit for this program.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
