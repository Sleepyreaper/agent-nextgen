"""
Seed database with ALL Georgia high schools from Wikipedia data.

Steps:
1. Clears all existing school_enriched_data records (garbage + old seeds)
2. Loads data/ga_high_schools.json (364 schools)
3. Creates skeleton records with analysis_status='pending' for Naveen/Moana to enrich

Usage:
    python scripts/seed_ga_schools.py              # Full reset + seed
    python scripts/seed_ga_schools.py --no-clear   # Seed only (skip delete)
    python scripts/seed_ga_schools.py --dry-run     # Preview without changes
